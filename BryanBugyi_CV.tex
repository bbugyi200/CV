\item
	\ressubheading{Edgestream Partners, L.P.}{Princeton, NJ}{Software Engineer}{May 2019 - Current} \vspace{8pt}

        As a Software Engineer on the Production team at Edgestream, my work centered around the improvement / maintenance of Edgestream's production trading system. This system is Linux-based (Red Hat) and is written primarily in Python. A few notable achievements associated with my work at Edgestream are listed below: \vspace{-4pt}
	\begin{itemize}
            \resitem{Integrated pylint into a codebase with well over a million lines of existing code. As the lead on this project, I was responsible for building several non-trivial tools to aid in making this integration a success.}
            \resitem{Made several large-scale improvements to the production department's in-house testing framework/runner.}
            \resitem{Lead developer of Edgestream's investor-facing web portal, which was built using Python's Django web framework.}
	\end{itemize}
    \item
    \ressubheading{Comcast}{Mount Laurel, NJ}{Tier III Technical Support}{2011 - 2016} \vspace{8pt}

        Tier III Technical Support at Comcast was a liaison group that worked to resolved chronic customer issues as well as outages which were impacting multiple customers. This involved troubleshooting Comcast's network to resolve the issue directly or, failing at that, escalating to the appropriate Engineering group and working with them to diagnose and resolve the issue cooperatively. Some of the other responsibilities associated with this role are listed below: \vspace{-4pt}
    \begin{itemize}
            \resitem{Monitored for large-scale network outages by aggregating and analyzing customer issue data from our ticketing system.} 
            \resitem{Used Python scripting to automate frequent department tasks (e.g. parsing spreadsheets, opening/closing tickets, information retrieval).}
    \end{itemize}
