    \sub{Languages}\\
        I have assigned each of the languages listed below a rank between 1-3 to indicate my level of proficiency with that language. A rank of 1 indicates that I have taken a college course that made use of the language and/or have read a book about the language. A rank of 2 indicates that I have also written over 5000 lines of code in the language. And a rank of 3 indicates that I have also written over 30000 lines of code in the language.\\\vspace{0.2cm}
